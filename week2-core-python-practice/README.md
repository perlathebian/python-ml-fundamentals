## Week 2 – Core Python Practice

This week focuses on building **strong Python fundamentals** through hands-on scripts rather than tutorials or notebooks.  
The goal is to become comfortable writing, debugging, and structuring Python programs independently.

### What this demonstrates

- Ability to write and reason about Python code without scaffolding
- Comfort with control flow, functions, and error handling
- Experience debugging and logging real programs
- Practical use of Python standard library tools
- Clean, readable scripts suitable for code review

---

### Key skills practiced

- Input / output and user interaction
- Conditionals and control flow
- Loops and simulations
- Function design and return values
- Exception handling and defensive programming
- Debugging techniques
- Logging (console and file-based)
- Dictionary-based data modeling and validation
- String processing and formatting
- Clipboard automation
- Terminal-based UIs

---

### Scripts included

#### Debugging, validation, and reliability

- **`box_print.py`**  
  Draws a text-based box with strict input validation and exception handling.

- **`debugging_coin_toss_game.py`**  
  Interactive guessing game improved through debugging and logic fixes.

- **`coin_flip_streaks.py`**  
  Monte Carlo–style simulation estimating the probability of streaks in coin flips.

- **`chessDictionaryValidator.py`**  
  Validates a chess board represented as a dictionary (piece counts, square validity, and rules).

---

#### Functions and logging

- **`factorial_logging_terminal.py`**  
  Factorial computation with step-by-step debug logging to the terminal.

- **`factorial_logging_file.py`**  
  Same computation with logs written to a file, demonstrating persistent logging.

---

#### Data structures and program structure

- **`fantasyGameInventory.py`**  
  Inventory system using dictionaries, with functions to display and update items.

- **`birthdays.py`**  
  Interactive dictionary-based lookup and update program.

---

#### Larger structured scripts

- **`chessboard.py`**  
  Interactive ASCII chess board supporting commands to move, add, remove, reset, and fill pieces.  
  Emphasizes data modeling, command parsing, and program structure (no chess rules enforced).

---

#### Text processing and automation

- **`alternatingText.py`**  
  Reads text from the system clipboard, applies alternating character casing, and writes it back.

- **`bulletPointAdder.py`**  
  Prepends bullet points to each line of clipboard text.

- **`pigLatin.py`**  
  Translates English text into Pig Latin while preserving punctuation and casing.

- **`tablePrinter.py`**  
  Prints a right-justified table from a list of lists by dynamically computing column widths.

---

### Outcome

By the end of this week, I am able to:

- Write complete Python scripts without external templates
- Debug logic and runtime errors confidently
- Use logging and exceptions to make programs more reliable
- Structure small programs cleanly for readability and reuse
- Commit and track incremental progress using Git and GitHub
